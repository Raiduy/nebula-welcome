import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Nebula **does not** save any of your conversations with the models unless saving is explicitly requested. Sometimes, the content of the prompt **may appear** in the system logs. These system logs are used to diagnose problems with the Nebula platform. The system logs are reset every two days.

<Aside>In other words, your conversations with LLMs can exist on the server for at most two days.</Aside>

Nebula **does not** use any of your conversations to train or improve the models.

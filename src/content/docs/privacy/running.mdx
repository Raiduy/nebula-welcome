description: A guide to how the Nebula platform runs

Nebula is based on the [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) interface and uses [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) as the backend for running the large language models. 

Currently, all services that are part of Nebula are running fully localized on the VU Campus on our dedicated servers. This allows us full control over what and how data is saved, cached, and used.

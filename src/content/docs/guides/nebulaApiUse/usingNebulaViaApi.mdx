Nebula is compatible with the OpenAI API standard, thus you can use the OpenAI package to send prompts to Nebula (very nice and convenient).
Please check [this repository](https://github.com/networkinstitutevu/nebula-api-examples) for examples for how to use the API for different use cases.
The repository is still in progress, we are doing our best to extend the list of API use examples as soon as possible.

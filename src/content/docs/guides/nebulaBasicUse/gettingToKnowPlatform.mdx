Nebula’s interface is similar to other popular large language model platforms, so if you use
other AI platforms you may find it familiar.

The text box in the middle of the screen can be used to chat with the models. These chats are **not saved**, and they will **disappear** as soon as you create a new conversation, refresh,or leave the page. To learn how to save chats, please check the [Saving Chats](/welcome/savingChats/).

<Aside type="caution" text="WARNING!">**ALWAYS** verify information generated by LLMs!</Aside>

Using the “+” button on the lower left side of the prompt text box, you can add files,
photos, public web pages, and [Knowledge Bases](/welcome/knowledgeBases/) to the prompt.

Different models can be selected using the dropdown at the top left of the screen. This
dropdown contains a combination of both original models, and user-created models. The
original models can be distinguished from the user-created models by the naming
convention \<optional_tag\>.\<model_name\>:\<number_of_parameters\>b (e.g., gemma3:12b
or FAST.gpt-oss:20b) identifying the original models.

In the interest of privacy, conversations with large language models are not saved in
Nebula. This also means that your conversation is going to disappear as soon as you
create a new conversation, refresh, or leave the page.

The Models tab allows you to create your own custom models by setting system prompts, attaching knowledge bases by default (no more need to click on the + button when prompting), or adjusting the advanced parameters. By attaching a knowledge base, you are creating a RAG system. See [here]() for the official documentation.

### Creating Models

1. Navigate to **Workspace**, then click on **Models**. You should see all the models created by other users that are public on Nebula.
2. Click on the <img src="/src/assets/newModelBtn.png" style="display:inline;margin:0;"/> button on the top right of the screen.
3. Follow the instructions on the screen for creating the Model.

     a. We recommend setting a System Prompt. Example: “You are a helpful assistant”

    b. Please have a look at the [Advanced Parameters](), and [Modifying Advanced Parameters]() sections if you want to edit the advanced parameters section
4. Click on **Save & Create**.

### Editing Models

1. Navigate to the models tab (Workspace -> Models).
2. On the model you want to edit, click on the  <img src="/src/assets/threeDots.png" height="20" style="margin:0; display: inline;"/>, then <img src="/src/assets/editBtn.png" height="15" style="margin:0; display: inline;"/> . You can only edit models that do not have the <img src="/src/assets/readOnly.png" height="20" style="margin:0; display: inline;"/> tag.
3. Edit your model.
4. Click on **Save & Update**.

### Deleting Models

1. Navigate to the models tab (Workspace -> Models).
2. Click on the three horizontal dots next to your knowledge base. You can only delete models that do not have the <img src="/src/assets/readOnly.png" height="20" style="margin:0; display: inline;"/>  tag.
3. Click on **Delete**.

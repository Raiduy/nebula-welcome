Knowledge bases allow you to add files that the models can reference when giving you an
answer, thus decreasing the chances of the model hallucinating. In more technical terms,
using a knowledge base with a model creates a form of Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG).
See [here]() for the official documentation.

<span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">WARNING: Knowledge bases are saved on the server! DO NOT upload sensitive
information to the Knowledge Bases!</span>

If you need to use knowledge bases with sensitive information for your project, please
contact us (nebula.cs@vu.nl) and we can discuss options.

### Creating knowledge bases

1. Navigate to **Workspace**, then click on **Knowledge**. You should see all the Knowledge Bases that are public on Nebula with the <img src="/src/assets/readOnly.png" style="display:inline;margin:0;"/> tag.
2. Click on the<img src="/src/assets/knowledgeBtn.png" style="display:inline;margin:0;"/> button on the top right of the screen.
3. Follow the instructions on the screen for creating the Knowledge Base
4. Click the <img src="/src/assets/plusBtn.png" style="display:inline;margin:0; width:16px;"/> button  at the top right of your screen and choose what to upload:

   a.<img src="/src/assets/uploadFileBtn.png" style="display:inline;margin:0;height:22px;"/> allows you to upload individual files.

   b.<img src="/src/assets/uploadDirBtn.png" style="display:inline;margin:0;height:22px;"/> allows you to upload an entire folder.

   c.<img src="/src/assets/syncBtn.png" style="display:inline;margin:0;height:22px;"/> allows you to synchronize a folder created via the Folders option.

   d.<img src="/src/assets/addWebPageBtn.png" style="display:inline;margin:0;height:22px;"/> allows you to add a public web page.

   e.<img src="/src/assets/addTextBtn.png" style="display:inline;margin:0;height:22px;"/> allows you to type text yourself.

5. Try out the knowledge base by prompting a large language model and adding your
knowledge base by clicking on the plus button on the bottom of the prompt box.


**NOTE: Currently Nebula only supports simple file formats such as .txt, .md, and .pdf.
Tables in PDF files cannot be read. We are working on a solution, thank you for
understanding.**

### Editing knowledge bases

1. Navigate to the knowledge tab (Workspace -> Knowledge)
2. Click on the knowledge base you want to edit. You can only edit knowledge bases that do not have the  <img src="/src/assets/readOnly.png" style="display:inline;margin:0;"/> tag.

### Deleting knowledge bases

1. Navigate to the knowledge tab (Workspace -> Knowledge).
2. Click on the three horizontal dots next to your knowledge base. You can only delete knowledge bases that do not have the  <img src="/src/assets/readOnly.png" style="display:inline;margin:0;"/> tag.
3. Click on **Delete**.

     a. All files in the knowledge base are going to be removed from the server as soon as you delete the knowledge base, and within 7 days from all backups.

description: How and when backups of Nebula occur.
---

Nebula is backed up automatically daily at 4:00 CET (Amsterdam Time). Expect around a 10 minute downtime during the backup window. The files in the backup are encrypted and stored on a remote server at the Network Institute. We keep at most 7 days of backup.

The Nebula computers are running on a separate VLAN within the VU network which is located in the DMZ of the VU network. This allows for easy reachability while, at the same time, profit from security measures implemented by the VU and SURF.

User administration is currently restricted to 3 accounts. User accounts are always created based on research projects and are by definition temporary. User accounts are protected by standard user-password authentication.

<Aside>**We are currently looking into migrating the login system to one that enables the use of 2-Factor Authentication.**</Aside>

The Network Institute does not retain the data generated by using Nebula after the research project is finished. All user data and accounts will be permanently deleted after the research project is closed.
